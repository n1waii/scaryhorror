# Horror Game Project
Source code for a horror game called "Guilt".
I made it open-source because the game was never published, but this still has some of my nice work.

I used the Knit framework for the entire architecture. For the user interface, I went with Roact and Rodux.

The "neat things": 
* Smooth dynamic pathfinding that can scale up to a lot of NPCs 
* Good architecture overall. Especially for front-end UI.
* Dynamic sound library called "Soundly" (which is private but the old code should still be in here. It might be a few commits behind)
* Elegant horror event handling system.
* Scalable and fast interactive game object system
* And lots more!
